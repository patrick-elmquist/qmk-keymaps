TODO:
- Evaluate Auto Shift
- Replace custom caps word implementation with the built in one (if it makes sense)
- Investigate if usb split detection has anything to do with it taking a disconnect/connect cycle for the keyboard to work
- Hardware: add some solder to X and A switches on the Sweep
- Investigate vertical combos for programming bigrams like ==, >=, <=, ?:, ?., -> etc
- Add shortcuts for common VIM shortcuts like split, Ex etc
- Should I add regular Caps word or is screaming snake enough?
- Investigate why the cleanup of Sweep config.h messed up the home row mods
